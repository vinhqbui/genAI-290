# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Final Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to improve the quality of large language model (LLM) responses. By retrieving information from a vector database, the pipeline enhances prompt relevance and accuracy.

## Key Features
- **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieves relevant information from vector databases to augment LLM prompts.
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilized LangChain for orchestration and optimized prompting techniques.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Designed metrics to compare LLM responses to a golden dataset, achieving over 0.9 in faithfulness and relevance.

## Files
- `2024_Summer_GenAI290_assignment_V.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code implementation.
- `Report RAG Application.pdf`: Detailed report on the RAG application and performance.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the RAG pipeline.
