    "# DATASCI 290 - GenAI - Assignment 5\n",
    "\n",
    "In Assignment 5 you will create and test a RAG system yourself, and write a corresponding business proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall scenario is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "You work at a tech company that is looking for new ways to organize their question answering and search capabilities to accelerate both engineering activity and the marketing team. The company also wants to roll out new GenAI-based products, so a lot of the questions will center around Generative AI concepts. The company has about 300 engineers and a marketing staff of 40. Product releases are done quarterly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your role is to implement and conduct a (mini-)POC helping the company to evaluate RAG capabilities for the improvement of their document search (and corresponding question answering), supporting particularly the engineering and marketing organizations. You will have a gold dataset with 'good' responses to questions from marketing and engineering teams. You need to develop metric(s) that help you to evaluate how well your RAG system performs relative to the gold data. You should work with the tunables of the setup (LLM, chunking, embeddings, ...) for your iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to write up your findings as a short proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "(See instructions throughout this notebook.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So overall, the goals of this assignment is for you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  To implement a RAG system using LangChain\n",
    "*  Be able to formulate metric(s) that you may want to choose as your evaluation to what degree your system replicates gold answers (labeled data) that we will provide.\n",
    "* Try out various hyper-parameters and settings to see which configuration works the best (given your chosen metric)  \n",
    "* Write a comprehensive evaluation, which also includes risks and limitations (and a lot more)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Base RAG components\n",
    "\n",
    "    We will provide a base LangChain-based framework for you to use for your RAG system. The components we’ll need include:  \n",

    "  2.1 Text Embeddings    \n",
    "  2.2 Text Chunking   \n",
    "  2.3 The Vector DB & Semantic Search  \n",
    "  2.4 The Language Model   \n",
    "  2.5 Testing the LLM in a LangChain Chain   \n",
    "  2.6. Setting up a simple RAG Chain     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using RAG  \n",
    "  3.1 Loading of Data  \n",
    "  3.2 Test Queries\n",

    "\n",
    "4.  Evaluations\n",

    "  Here, you will conduct your evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final Results\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this section you provide the RAG answers to the test questions\n",
    "\n",
    "RULES:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* You can only use the language models specified here  \n",
    "* You can only use the embedding methods we discuss  \n",
    "* You can only use the focuments we provide. And they all must be in your store   \n",
    "* Apart from the provided specifications, some of the things you can freely experiment with include chunk sizes, prompts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run this notebook** you should copy it to your personal Colab Pro Google account by uploading it into your Google Drive. From there you can open it as a Colab notebook and run it.  Note it needs a T4 GPU to run.  You may be able to run it in a free Colab notebook.\n",

By fine-tuning the model with common QA datasets, engineers can optimize the model's ability to answer questions accurately. However, there is a concern about the significant overlap between questions in the train and test sets of public QA datasets, which could affect the generalization ability of the fine-tuned models.

Factors such as the quality and relevance of the training examples, the learning rate or schedule, and the model's sensitivity to different hyperparameters can also play a significant role in determining performance variability. Additionally, the complexity of the task or dataset being used for training can impact how effectively the model scales with size. It is essential to consider these factors holistically when optimizing model performance rather than relying solely on increasing model size.\",\n",

Mistral and Cohere models will be tasked with evaluating responses generated by their peers, using a Likert scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). This blind evaluation will provide insights into the perceived quality of responses from the perspective of state-of-the-art language models.\n",

The SuperNaturalInstructions dataset provides natural language instructions, which can be paired with positive and negative examples to form training samples. Additionally, for tasks like classification or similarity, training samples can be constructed by selecting text sequences associated with different classes or similarities.
